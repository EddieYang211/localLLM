\title{Start automatic run documentation}
\usage{
document_start(path = NULL, metadata = list(), append = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Optional destination path for the log file. Defaults to
`localLLM_run_<timestamp>.txt` in the current working directory.}

\item{metadata}{Optional named list of user-defined metadata to include in the
log header (e.g. project name, dataset id).}

\item{append}{When `TRUE`, entries are appended to an existing file instead of
overwriting it.}
}
\value{
The path that will be written when [document_end()] is called.
}
\description{
Calling `document_start()` enables automatic logging for subsequent
`localLLM` calls. Information such as timestamps, models, and generation
settings are buffered in-memory until [document_end()] is invoked, at which
point a human-readable text report is written to disk.
