Description: The 'localLLM' package provides R bindings to the 'llama.cpp' library for running large language models.
    The package uses a lightweight architecture where the C++ backend library is downloaded
    at runtime rather than bundled with the package. 
    Package features include text generation, reproducible generation, and parallel inference.
