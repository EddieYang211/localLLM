## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes around package/software names in DESCRIPTION (Title and Description fields)
* Added \value documentation to all exported functions (backend_init, backend_free, quick_llama_reset)
* Updated examples to use tempdir() instead of writing to user home directories

All three issues raised in the previous CRAN review have been addressed.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* NOTE: New submission (standard for first-time package)
* NOTE: unable to verify current time (system-specific, not a package issue)

## Test environments

* local macOS install, R 4.4.1
* local Windows install, R 4.5.1
* win-builder (R-devel, R-release)
* GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest), R-release

## Recent improvements

* Fixed CRAN submission requirements: added single quotes to package names in DESCRIPTION
* Added \value documentation to all exported functions (backend_init, backend_free, quick_llama_reset)
* Updated examples to use tempdir() instead of writing to user directories
* Added Makevars.win for Windows compilation support

## Note about C++17

The package uses C++17 features as specified in SystemRequirements.
Successfully tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

## Note about package architecture

This package uses a lightweight architecture where the C++ backend library
(llama.cpp) is downloaded at runtime via install_localLLM() rather than
bundled with the package. This design significantly reduces package size
and simplifies cross-platform distribution.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
