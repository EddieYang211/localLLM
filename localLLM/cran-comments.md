## Note about C++17

The package uses C++17 features as specified in SystemRequirements.
Successfully tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

## Note about package architecture

This package uses a lightweight architecture where the C++ backend library
(llama.cpp) is downloaded at runtime via install_localLLM() rather than
bundled with the package. This design significantly reduces package size
and simplifies cross-platform distribution.
